	Privacy Policy</h1>
<h6>
	Last updated Feb 12, 2013</h6>
<p>
	Mysourceblog, Inc. (&ldquo;Mysourceblog&rdquo;) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our software applications (including any updates, new versions or new releases thereof) for use on mobile devices including, but not limited to, Android operating system (each a &ldquo;Mysourceblog Application&rdquo;), our website located at www.Mysourceblog.com (&ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and any other services offered by Mysourceblog in connection with a Mysourceblog Application or the Site (any and all of the foregoing the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and Services.</p>
<p>
	This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by making the new Privacy Policy available on the Site or via our Services. You are advised to consult this policy regularly for any changes.</p>
<p>

<h3>
	Information Collection: Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			In the course of using the Site and Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you and administer your use and enjoyment of the Services (&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;). Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number and email address. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries. For example, when you choose to interact with and use certain social networking services (&ldquo;SNSs&rdquo;) via the Services we collect the user credentials for your SNS account which typically includes your name, email address, gender, user ID, list of friends, and any other information you&rsquo;ve chosen to make public through such SNS.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your user experience (e.g., without limitation, zip code or location (in either case on their own) and individual preferences) (&ldquo;Non-Identifying Information&rdquo;).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non- identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Mysourceblog users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance, to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions, for advertising or advertising targeting purposes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Mysourceblog newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
	

<h3>
	Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
<p>
	If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@Mysourceblog.com. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information.</p>
<p>

<h3>
	Cookies &amp; Other Technologies</h3>
<p>
	Like many websites, we use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer&rsquo;s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use &ldquo;persistent cookies&rdquo; to save your username and login password for future logins to the Site. We also may use &ldquo;session ID cookies&rdquo; to enable certain features of the Site or Services, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor web traffic routing on the Site and aggregate usage of the Site and Services. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services. Cookies placed on your device or computer by Mysourceblog or any third party site or service that you may access through the Services may remain stored on your device or computer until you remove them.</p>
<p>
	We may also use &ldquo;pixel tags,&rdquo; &ldquo;web beacons,&rdquo; &ldquo;clear GIFs&rdquo; or similar means (individually or collectively &ldquo;Pixel Tags&rdquo;) in connection with our Services to collect usage, demographic and geographical location data. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel, that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on a user&rsquo;s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>

<h3>
	Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>
	
<p>
	<strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</strong> We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, including analysis of how our Site and Services are used, demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Services Providers.</strong> We employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of our Services&rsquo; features), to provide the Services on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong> Mysourceblog cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Mysourceblog or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Business Transfers.</strong> Mysourceblog may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>

	<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
	Mysourceblog is very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ reasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p>
	If Mysourceblog learns of a security breach that results in the unauthorized disclosure of your Personal Information, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Services or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Services. Mysourceblog may post a notice on its Site or within the Mysourceblog Application if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser or mobile device enabling you to view the notice. Mysourceblog may also send an e-mail to you at the e-mail address you have provided to us for a notification pursuant to this paragraph. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice), you should notify us at info@Mysourceblog.com.</p>

<h3>
	Phishing</h3>
